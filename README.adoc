= Wholeable

Wholeable allows you to turn your object into a _whole value object_ by ensuring object equality is determined by the values of the object instead of by identity. Whole value objects -- or value objects in general -- have the following traits as noted via link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_object[Wikipedia]:

* Equality is determined by the values that make up an object and not by link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(object-oriented_programming)[identity] (i.e. memory address) which is the default behavior for all {ruby_link} objects except for {data_link} and {structs_link}.
* Identity remains unique since two objects can have the same values but different identity. This means `BasicObject#equal?` is never overwritten -- which is strongly discouraged -- as per link:https://rubyapi.org/o/basicobject#method-i-3D-3D[BasicObject] documentation.
* Value objects should be immutable (i.e. frozen) by default. This implementation enforces a strict adherence to immutability in order to ensure value objects remain equal and discourage mutation.

== Features

* Ensures equality (i.e. `#==` and `#eql?`) is determined by attribute values and not object identity (i.e. `#equal?`).
* Allows you to compare two objects of same or different types and see their differences.
* Provides {pattern_matching_link}.
* Automatically defines public attribute readers (i.e. `.attr_reader`) based on provided keys.
* Ensures object inspection (i.e. `#inspect`) shows all registered attributes.
* Ensures object is frozen upon initialization.

== Requirements

. {ruby_link}.

== Setup

To install _with_ security, run:

[source,bash]
----
# ðŸ’¡ Skip this line if you already have the public certificate installed.
gem cert --add <(curl --compressed --location https://alchemists.io/gems.pem)
gem install wholeable --trust-policy HighSecurity
----

To install _without_ security, run:

[source,bash]
----
gem install wholeable
----

You can also add the gem directly to your project:

[source,bash]
----
bundle add wholeable
----

Once the gem is installed, you only need to require it:

[source,ruby]
----
require "wholeable"
----

== Usage

To use, include Wholeable along with a list of attributes that make up your whole value object:

[source,ruby]
----
class Person
  include Wholeable[:name, :email]

  def initialize name:, email:
    @name = name
    @email = email
  end
end

jill = Person.new name: "Jill Smith", email: "jill@example.com"
jill_two = Person.new name: "Jill Smith", email: "jill@example.com"
jack = Person.new name: "Jack Smith", email: "jack@example.com"

jill.name              # "Jill Smith"
jill.email             # "jill@example.com"

jill.frozen?           # true
jill_two.frozen?       # true
jack.frozen?           # true

jill.inspect           # "#<Person @name=\"Jill Smith\", @email=\"jill@example.com\">"
jill_two.inspect       # "#<Person @name=\"Jill Smith\", @email=\"jill@example.com\">"
jack.inspect           # "#<Person @name=\"Jack Smith\", @email=\"jack@example.com\">"

jill == jill           # true
jill == jill_two       # true
jill == jack           # false

jill.diff(jill)        # {}
jill.diff(jack)        # {
                       #   name: ["Jill Smith", "Jack Smith"],
                       #   email: ["jill@example.com", "jack@example.com"]
                       # }
jill.diff(Object.new)  # {:name=>["Jill Smith", nil], :email=>["jill@example.com", nil]}

jill.eql? jill         # true
jill.eql? jill_two     # true
jill.eql? jack         # false

jill.equal? jill       # true
jill.equal? jill_two   # false
jill.equal? jack       # false

jill.hash              # 3650965837788801745
jill_two.hash          # 3650965837788801745
jack.hash              # 4460658980509842640

jill.to_a              # ["Jill Smith", "jill@example.com"]
jack.to_a              # ["Jack Smith", "jack@example.com"]

jill.to_h              # {:name=>"Jill Smith", :email=>"jill@example.com"}
jack.to_h              # {:name=>"Jack Smith", :email=>"jack@example.com"}

jill.with name: "Sue"  # #<Person @name="Sue", @email="jill@example.com">
jill.with bad: "!"     # unknown keyword: :bad (ArgumentError)
----

As you can see, object equality is determined by the object's values and _not_ by the object's identity. When you include `Wholeable` along with a list of keys, the following happens:

. The corresponding _public_ `attr_reader` for each key is created which saves you time and reduces double entry when implementing your whole value object.
. The `#to_a` and `#to_h` methods are added for convenience in order to play nice with {data_link} and {structs_link}.
. The `#deconstruct` and `#deconstruct_keys` aliases are created so you can leverage {pattern_matching_link}.
. The `#==`, `#eql?`, `#hash`, `#inspect`, and `#with` methods are added to provide whole value behavior.
. The object is immediately frozen after initialization to ensure your instance is _immutable_ by default.

== Caveats

Whole values can be broken via the following:

* *Duplication*: Sending the `#dup` message will cause your whole value object to be unfrozen. This might be desired in certain situations but make sure to refreeze afterwards.
* *Post Attributes*: Adding additional attributes after what is defined when including `Wholeable` will break your whole value object. To prevent this, let Wholeable manage this for you (easiest). Otherwise (harder), you can manually override `#==`, `#eql?`, `#hash`, `#inspect`, `#to_a`, and `#to_h` behavior at which point you don't need Wholeable anymore.
* *Deep Freezing*: The automatic freezing of your instances is shallow and will not deeply freeze nested attributes. This behavior mimics the behavior of {data_link} objects.

== Development

To contribute, run:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/bkuhlmann/wholeable
cd wholeable
bin/setup
----

You can also use the IRB console for direct access to all objects:

[source,bash]
----
bin/console
